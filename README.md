# Owllex Innovation

Our product is a way to crowd source legal research. By taking a user's search query into account, our chrome extension will show each advance lexis result with a specific score, leading to less scanning through documents for researchers.

## Getting Started

The extension is not public at the moment so you will need to install it. Please clone the repo or download the zip file by clicking the green "Clone or download" button at the top of this page.

After installing the files, navigate to <chrome://extensions/> or click the three vertical dots at the top right of the chrome browser, go to "More Tools" and click "Extensions".

Click "Load Unpacked", navigate to the directory that contains the chrome extension and select it. The extension should now be in your toolbar up at the top of google chrome!

### Prerequisites

Here's how to use the extension:

First, click the refresh symbol and make sure the background page doesn't say (inactive) after "background page".

Then, click the details button and scroll down to "Extension Options" and open the link. The page that opens has no content on it, but it is necessary for connecting to firebase.

Next, go to (https://advance.lexis.com/), type in the search query, click on the icon for the Owllex extension, then click on the green button and the interface should pop up!

### Troubleshooting

If the button after clicking the extension is white and not green, then you need to reset the extension by clicking the refresh button and reopen the extension options page.
